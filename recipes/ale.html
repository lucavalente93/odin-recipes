    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A rustic ale brewed from malted barley and honey, lightly fermented to produce a slightly sweet and earthy drink.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 gallon (3.8 liters) water</li>
        <li>1 cup malted barley or crushed malt</li>
        <li>1 cup honey (for a touch of sweetness)</li>
        <li>1-2 handfuls of hops (optional, as hops were used later; you can use other herbs like juniper berries for flavor)</li>
        <li>Yeast (if available; otherwise, let natural fermentation take its course)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the Water: Heat the water in a large pot. Once it’s boiling, remove it from heat.</li>
        <li>Add Malt: Stir in the malted barley. Let it steep for about an hour to extract the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add Honey: Stir in the honey. If you’re using hops or other herbs, add them at this point.</li>
        <li>Cool and Ferment: Let the mixture cool to room temperature. If you have yeast, add it; otherwise,<p></p>
        cover the pot with a cloth and let it sit in a warm place for a few days to ferment naturally.</li>
        <li>Bottle and Age: Once fermentation slows down (you’ll see bubbles stop), strain the mixture and bottle it.
            <p>

            </p>Let it age for at least a couple of weeks before drinking.</li>
    </ol>
